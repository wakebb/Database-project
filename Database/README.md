# Car-Rental-Database-Design
Design of a database system for car rental, including website design by implementing PHP and HTML.  



In this project, we design a database system for car rental. 
First we conduct research about the system of car rental and collect data requirements 
(such as information about the main components of the system, how the system works, how different entities interact with each other etc.)
Then we try to design a system as practical as possible and comply well with real-world situation/scenarios.
